      <br/> 64-Bit Downgrade, Dualboot & Jailbreak Utility
   </h1>
</div>

<h4 align="center"> Uses seprmvr64 by mineek<h4>
<h6 align="center"> Supports* iOS 7.0.4-12.1.2 as well as A7-A10 devices </h6>

# IF YOUR DEVICE SUPPORTS [LEGACY-IOS-KIT](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit), YOU SHOULD REALLY USE THAT OVER THIS.

# Chart of device compatibility
all a7-a10 devices are supported on ios 7-12.5.7
** These versions can only be tether booted with semaphorin, dualboot is only supported when downgrading to iOS 10.3.3 or later. You will lose all your data on your device if you downgrade to any of these versions, please keep that in mind before using this tool.

## How do I use this?
Coming soon
## Requirements
linux or mac
Stable internet connection. Please don't try using this with dial up...

At least 20GB of free space on your computer

USB Type-A port and Lightning cable. USB Type-C ports will **NOT** work with this script. If you're using a Mac that only has a USB-C port (such as 12" MacBooks, and late Intel MacBook Airs) a dongle/dock with a USB-A port should work just fine with a standard USB-A to Lightning cable.

Working iDevice: The script has to backup `apticket.der`, `sep-firmware.img4`, `Baseband`, and `keybags` from your device before you can downgrade to an older iOS version.

## Support
in issues tab
## Setup.app bypass
script will do this automatilly
